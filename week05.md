## Task3. Drawing Routing Table

## Task4.
Scenario: A student submits a plagiarized essay for an assignment.

CQU Policy Outcomes: According to CQU policy, the student could face a range of consequences, including a failing grade for the assignment, a suspension, or even expulsion.

Recommendations:

Proper citation: Always cite sources accurately and avoid plagiarism. Use a citation style guide (e.g., APA, MLA) to ensure correct formatting.
Paraphrase effectively: Instead of copying directly from a source, paraphrase the information in your own words. This shows that you understand the material.


## Task5. 
I used an online IP address lookup website to determine my location across two different networks: home Wi-Fi and mobile data. While the website was generally accurate in identifying my city or region, it did not provide my exact location. This is likely due to the nature of IP address assignment and the potential use of privacy-enhancing technologies.
It's important to be mindful of privacy concerns when using online tools that rely on IP addresses. While they can provide useful information, they may also expose personal data.
